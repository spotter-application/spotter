# Spotter

Spotter is a productivity tool, the main function is to search and launch external application actions and applications themselves. (e.g. switch the next song or set a timer...) so you can stay focused on your current task. Kind of Spotlight or Alfred alternative.

## The main idea

* 🔮&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Provide an api on the native level
* ⚛️&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;React app uses it and implements various plugins

It will allow the application to remain native and be available for developing javascript/typescript plugins.

## Troubleshooting

#### The application “spotter” can’t be opened.

```chmod +x "/Applications/spotter.app/Contents/MacOS/Spotter```

#### spotter can’t be opened because Apple cannot check it for malicious software.

Go to System Preference -> Privacity and Security -> General -> And Press "Open Anyway"
